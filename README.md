# Assets Engine

Paper plugin working together with Oraxen (for now) that help you bring bbmodel to the game.

# Credits

**All of the credits goes to** [AtlasEngineCA](https://github.com/AtlasEngineCa/WorldSeedEntityEngine/blob/master/LICENSE) team and their repository WorldSeedEngine.

The only thing I did on the forked repository is :
- Switch to PaperMC for Paper / Spigot support
- Switch to ProtocolLib for Packet handling
- Added Oraxen support for pack upload
